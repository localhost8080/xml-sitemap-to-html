if you can use it, then great :D by Jonathan Mitchell

tested on osx and linux (Mavericks and linux mint) - but its a bash script, so it should work where you have bash, cat, awk and grep

once downloaded you will need to chmod +x the file to make it executable


usage:
sitemap-xml-to-html input_file

output will be to STDOUT so you can direct it with pipes etc
